This is my fresh, sick and dope repository! I'm shooting my chance at becoming a tech star. 

My favorite restaurant is Chipotle. My order from there is always a bowl with brown rice, pinto beans, chicken, pico de gallo, corn-salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac and lettuce! The ultimate combo. Now I'm hungry because I wrote about Chipotle.
